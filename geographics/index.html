       It is literally impossible to experience our reality without mediation by technology. Our <em>world</em> is becoming reorganised into information. If this information acts as a copy of reality. Like a recording. Who or what is controlling it? Organising it? Requesting it? Or is it an accidental super network with a life of its own?
       
       Augmented reality is already here, it's not just inserting pokemon characters with your camera. It's Australia post tracking, QR codes, passport scanning, google tracking your location, sharing wifi routers.
       
       How did the <em>world</em> become a planetary-wide megastructure? What are its Capital / Media / Military protocols which have enabled the remote universal coordination of all information and action? This unnamed network is terraforming the <em>world</em> and datafying its inhabitants at an increasing pace, developing a new <em>world</em> in its own image, physically, politically and socially into a megastructure from beyond the Anthropocene. This unnamed network that extends beyond the internet and into every part of our lives needs a name.

       Benjamin Bratton is a digital philosopher and sociologist. In Bratton's recent book The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty (MIT Press, 2015) he has a developed a vocabulary for this new megastructure. Bratton uses the computational metaphor of <em>The Stack.</em>
       
       Bratton applies <em>The Stack</em> metaphor to planetary-scale activity, identifying it as an "accidental megastructure", and its effects are already here. A new kind of geopolitics that is less interested in territories and more interested in totalities. (5) Google, Facebook, Amazon wants every man, woman and child as their citizen. Sharing their lives with non-human bots. Platforms fight for popularity, engaging in guerrilla media tactics in hopes of gaining massive amounts of data to synthesize and then reprogram the <em>world</em> as a virtual one.

       <em>GeoGraphics</em> is a publication created by Monash Design Studies enrolled in the unit Digital Publishing. It is a representation of <em>The Stack</em> and how each student interprets each layer.
